## 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects 
* Advancements in technology bring with them an assortment of beneficial and harmful effects
* Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
* A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even the same person
* Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
* Computing innovations can be used in ways their creators didn’t originally intend
  * Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
  * Sometimes these can even be used in a way that may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture
  * It’s not possible for a programmer to be able to tell the future and all the ways something could go wrong
  * The more people rapidly and constantly using an app or innovation, the more chance that there is for it to go wrong or veer off the intended purpose

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
  * Beneficial effects: information can pass quickly through the internet, more sources online which you can search/find information online easily, bring more conveniences to our lives

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
  * It's true how video games and social media impact people chemically. But however, although playing video games and social media generate dopamine and bring us pleasure, but if we spent too much time on these stuff, it will be harmful to our mental health and body since wasting too much time on using phones/computers will eventually make us feel guilty and regret afterwards but still being addicted. Watching videos make me happy, but if I spent the time that I was suppose to use to do my homework on watching videos, I will have to stay up late and be regretful. This is not helping me with being successful in High School and is distracting me and bringing me trouble on my personal study.
